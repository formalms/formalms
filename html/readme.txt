For all new features and bugfixes included in this release, please read changelog.txt
Here are some notes from base release.

Attention
From release 2.2.0 the templates system checks the version of the template.
check and update your templates manifest as described in par. 3.0.0


Here are some important notes:

a) PHP support
   Full support for PHP from 7.4.x
   Dropped support for PHP < 7.4
   
b) Template System
   Refactored front-end (users) UI with native responsive system based on bootstrap
   Enhanced administrator templates .
   forma.lms 1.x.x templates are NOT supported 
   forma.lms 2.x.x templates are NOT supported
   While upgrading and running a version >=2.2.x or 3.x forma.lms will check the defined template and
   - if not supported - it will switch to the standard template. 
   A template labeled "standard" (the distributed one in the package) must always exist.
   A compliant template must have a manifest file that declares the version 
   If there is a need for improvements or bug fixes, the minimum supported version of the template supported
   will be changed also in minor release

   As a tip, never change the standard template, if you need customization copy it to a new one and change it
   
c) Privacy and GDPR compliance
   forma.lms is released with a compliant set of privacy features. The default settings comply with the GDPR 
   requirements. You can change these settings to suit your needs.
   Acceptance of privacy policy records who, when and which privacy policy has been acknowledged.
   Go to the privacy section of the administration section to setup privacy messages. 
   By default, forma.lms uses the privacy messages taken from the language translation. 
   Any modification must be made in the privacy settings section. 
   Please note that the default language translation privacy settings may be dropped in future releases.
   Each Organization chart node can have its own privacy policy. A node without a specific policy will used 
   the policy marked as "default"
   
   After upgrading from version 1.xx, all users must re-accept the privacy policy at the first login.

d) Public admin removed
   The "public admin" feature has been dropped since the 2.x.x versions.
   The "admin" feature remains and has been enhanced with new permissions
   
   During the upgrade from 1.xx, users with the "public admin" permissions will be reverted to standard 
   users. However, the courses and Organization chart node assigned to these users are preserved. 
   After the upgrade, you need to upgrade the affected users to the administrator role and assign them an
   administration profile (create a new one if necessary).

e) direct SSO link.
   The SSO direct link from an external site to forma.lms has changed since 2.x.x:
   v1.xx url:  http://yourformalms.domain.com/appLms/index.php
   v2.xx url:  http://yourformalms.domain.com/index.php
   All other parameters (token included) have not changed

f) Assessment
   Feature dropped in 2.x.x version
   
g) Plugin system
   The plugin system has been enhanced in the administration section and its use has been extended 
   into the system.
   Each plugin must have a manifest file to describe its version, forma.lms version and dependencies.
   Many components has been converted to plugins, and distributed with the core system:
   -- all the autorizations module
   -- the base video conferencing systems
   -- some reports
   With next releases, other components will be converted.
